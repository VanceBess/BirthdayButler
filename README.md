# BirthdayButler
This is an application that records special days and reminds you of this special day.
Birthdays, anniversaries, festivals, and the days that have passed together are worth remembering
After the user adds a birthday, the push is turned on (the default is off). First, the time of the first push is calculated according to the current time and the time selected by the user. Finally, the push period is set to one year.
I hope to get good advice from more users, and also welcome technical exchanges with other developers.
